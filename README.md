Homebrew-boneyard
=================

This repository contains formulae that were removed from other repositories.
Common reasons for retiring formulae to the boneyard include lack of upstream
maintenance or problems integrating with Homebrew's packaging requirements.
Broken formulae are migrated here as an alternative to allowing hard work and
valuable knowledge to fade into git history.

With a little work, some of these formulae could be restored to the main
repositories, but they are not actively maintained or kept up-to-date in this
repository.

Welcome to the boneyard, perhaps you can dig up something interesting!

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap homebrew/boneyard` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/boneyard/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-boneyard/master/<formula>.rb
```
